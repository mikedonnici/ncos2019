          Presenter: Qualified ADA assessor
          <br>Audience: all staff
          <br>Session: Both Session 1 and Session 2
        </p>

        <p>
          This is an informative session relevant to every classroom in both secondary and
          primary schools. Imagine the difference we could make to student results if we could
          identify and assist our dyslexic students. Many of these students are ‘left behind’ because
          of a lack of understanding and a lack of trained dyslexic teachers. This session is a start
          to understanding the dyslexic students in your classroom – most of whom will not have been
          formally assessed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Australian Dyslexia Association (ADA) states that dyslexia is estimated to affect
          approximately 10% of the Australian population. However, they believe this may be a conservative
          estimate as many individuals in Australia are left unidentified. In other English speaking
          countries, the figures are an astounding 20% (UK. USA and Canada.)
        </p>

        <p>
          This means one in five of our students could be affected by dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most
          common cause of reading, writing and spelling difficulties. Unfortunately, many classroom teachers
          are not aware of the signs that indicate dyslexia, where students can be assessed, specific
          classroom strategies for these students, or the training teachers can undertake to teach dyslexic
          students.
        </p>

        <p>Bomaderry High School has arranged for a qualified ADA assessor to present a two hour session on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What is dyslexia?</li>
          <li>What are the indicators you may be teaching a dyslexic student?</li>
          <li>Where can a student be assessed?</li>
          <li>What classroom accommodations need to be made for dyslexic students to succeed?</li>
          <li>What training is available from the ADA for teachers?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="notification blockquote"><i>‘Many students in schools go unidentified and unassisted, often it is not until they are failing 
          in literacy areas, that someone, wonders about dyslexia. It is never too late to get identified 
          and assisted</i>‘ – ADA</p>
