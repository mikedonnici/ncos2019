        <h3>Dyslexia</h3>

        <p>This is a two hour session you must select both session 1 and 2</p>

        <p class="notification is-info">
          Presenter: Qualified ADA assessor
          <br>Audience: all staff
          <br>Session: Both Session 1 and Session 2
        </p>

        <p>
          This is an informative session relevant to every classroom in both secondary and
          primary schools. Imagine the difference we could make to student results if we could
          identify and assist our dyslexic students. Many of these students are ‘left behind’ because
          of a lack of understanding and a lack of trained dyslexic teachers. This session is a start
          to understanding the dyslexic students in your classroom – most of whom will not have been
          formally assessed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Australian Dyslexia Association (ADA) states that dyslexia is estimated to affect
          approximately 10% of the Australian population. However, they believe this may be a conservative
          estimate as many individuals in Australia are left unidentified. In other English speaking
          countries, the figures are an astounding 20% (UK. USA and Canada.)
        </p>

        <p>
          This means one in five of our students could be affected by dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most
          common cause of reading, writing and spelling difficulties. Unfortunately, many classroom teachers
          are not aware of the signs that indicate dyslexia, where students can be assessed, specific
          classroom strategies for these students, or the training teachers can undertake to teach dyslexic
          students.
        </p>

        <p>Bomaderry High School has arranged for a qualified ADA assessor to present a two hour session on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What is dyslexia?</li>
          <li>What are the indicators you may be teaching a dyslexic student?</li>
          <li>Where can a student be assessed?</li>
          <li>What classroom accommodations need to be made for dyslexic students to succeed?</li>
          <li>What training is available from the ADA for teachers?</li>
        </ul>

            ‘Many students in schools go unidentified and unassisted, often it is
            not until they are failing in literacy areas, that someone, wonders about dyslexia. It is never too late to get identified
            and assisted

          “Science has moved forward at a rapid pace so that we now possess the data to reliably define
          dyslexia … For the student, the knowledge that he is dyslexic is empowering … [It provides him]
          with self-understanding and self-awareness of what he has and what he needs to do in order to
          succeed.” - Sally Shaywitz, M.D., co-director of Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity

        <h3>The Trauma Informed classroom</h3>
        <p>This is a two hour session you must select both session 1 and 2</p>

          In today’s changing and complex world, many primary and secondary school students encounter
          daily challenges that can impact their success at school. These range from ongoing stress and
          lack of family support to a specific traumatic event.
        </p>
        <p>
          This session builds on from last year's session called 'Trauma Informed Practice'; however,
          you will benefit from this session whether or not you attended last year. This session will
          provide you with a toolkit of activities, ideas and strategies to use in your classroom.

          Christine Gates, Head Teacher Science Bomaderry High School
          <br>Intended audience: K-6 and 7-12 support

        <p>
          This hands-on workshop is designed to easily show you how Science can be performed in a
          meaningful way using basic recycled and readily available resources. You will be given the
          chance to undertake a variety of experiments that can be modified and used for all age groups
          and cost very little. The experiments are designed to link with the Stage 1-3 syllabus, but could
          also be utilised in Stage 4-6 support classes. We will also discuss the correct metalanguage
          to be used in teaching Science along with how to conduct a student focussed, inquiry based
          fair test that will be useful for schools who run a Science Fair.
