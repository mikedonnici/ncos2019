        <h3>Dyslexia</h3>

        <p>This is a two hour session you must select both session 1 and 2</p>

        <p class="notification is-info">
          Presenter: Qualified ADA assessor
          <br>Audience: all staff
          <br>Session: Both Session 1 and Session 2
        </p>

        <p>
          This is an informative session relevant to every classroom in both secondary and
          primary schools. Imagine the difference we could make to student results if we could
          identify and assist our dyslexic students. Many of these students are ‘left behind’ because
          of a lack of understanding and a lack of trained dyslexic teachers. This session is a start
          to understanding the dyslexic students in your classroom – most of whom will not have been
          formally assessed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Australian Dyslexia Association (ADA) states that dyslexia is estimated to affect
          approximately 10% of the Australian population. However, they believe this may be a conservative
          estimate as many individuals in Australia are left unidentified. In other English speaking
          countries, the figures are an astounding 20% (UK. USA and Canada.)
        </p>

        <p>
          This means one in five of our students could be affected by dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most
          common cause of reading, writing and spelling difficulties. Unfortunately, many classroom teachers
          are not aware of the signs that indicate dyslexia, where students can be assessed, specific
          classroom strategies for these students, or the training teachers can undertake to teach dyslexic
          students.
        </p>

        <p>Bomaderry High School has arranged for a qualified ADA assessor to present a two hour session on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What is dyslexia?</li>
          <li>What are the indicators you may be teaching a dyslexic student?</li>
          <li>Where can a student be assessed?</li>
          <li>What classroom accommodations need to be made for dyslexic students to succeed?</li>
          <li>What training is available from the ADA for teachers?</li>
        </ul>

            ‘Many students in schools go unidentified and unassisted, often it is
            not until they are failing in literacy areas, that someone, wonders about dyslexia. It is never too late to get identified
            and assisted

          “Science has moved forward at a rapid pace so that we now possess the data to reliably define
          dyslexia … For the student, the knowledge that he is dyslexic is empowering … [It provides him]
          with self-understanding and self-awareness of what he has and what he needs to do in order to
          succeed.” - Sally Shaywitz, M.D., co-director of Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity

        </p>

        <p>
          In today’s changing and complex world, many primary and secondary school students encounter
          daily challenges that can impact their success at school. These range from ongoing stress and
          lack of family support to a specific traumatic event.
        </p>
        <p>
          This session builds on from last year's session called 'Trauma Informed Practice'; however,
          you will benefit from this session whether or not you attended last year. This session will
          provide you with a toolkit of activities, ideas and strategies to use in your classroom.

        </p>

        <p>
          This hands-on workshop is designed to easily show you how Science can be performed in a
          meaningful way using basic recycled and readily available resources. You will be given the
          chance to undertake a variety of experiments that can be modified and used for all age groups
          and cost very little. The experiments are designed to link with the Stage 1-3 syllabus, but could
          also be utilised in Stage 4-6 support classes. We will also discuss the correct metalanguage
          to be used in teaching Science along with how to conduct a student focussed, inquiry based
          fair test that will be useful for schools who run a Science Fair.

        </p>

        <p>
          How can we engage our students with short, focused (and fun!) numeracy activities? In this session,
          you will engage with a number of numeracy activities using minimal equipment such as dice and cards,
          and be introduced to some great online resources. You will return to your classroom ready to
          encourage your students to explain their strategies, justify their answers and develop a positive
          mindset around numeracy. Importantly, these activities can be differentiated for use in K-6 classrooms.
          Come along and be ready to join in for a fun session.

          successfully with their primary classes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seesaw is a platform for student engagement. Teachers can empower students to create,
          reflect, share, and collaborate. Students “show what they know” using photos, videos,
          drawings, text, PDFs, and links. It’s simple to get student work in one place and share
          with families, and nothing is shared without teacher approval.

        </p>

        <p>
          Number talks occur within numeracy lessons and allow students to individually solve a problem and
          then collaboratively discuss and explain their strategies with their classmates. During number
          talks, students have the opportunity to justify and prove their thinking, investigate and apply
          mathematical relationships, build a repertoire of efficient strategies and select the most efficient
          strategies for specific problems.

        <p>
          This session will be a presentation of practical strategies you can use in your classroom relating to
          Emotional Regulation and Visible Learning. I will run through a program called the Zones Of Regulation,
          which is a practical program enabling students to learn how to self-regulate, also providing ongoing
          tools to allow this skill to be generalised. You will view visible learning strategies which have enabled
          success in the ED classroom via individual learning plans and strategies. Many of these strategies
          align with the Berry Street Education Model (BSEM) and allow for flexible delivery in any setting.

            "Elemental music is not just music. It is bound up with movement, dance and speech, and so it is a
            form of music in which one must participate, in which one is involved not as a listener but as a
            co-performer"
          </i>
          <br>- Carl Orff
        </h5>

        <p>
          During this session, participants will gain an understanding of the skills Carl Orff developed in his
          method of teaching music to children. The session will begin with Orff's approach to teaching
          infants music using chant and body percussion to primary music with simple songs and instrumental
          accompaniment, then moving to stage 4 and onwards with pentatonic scales and chords progressions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Participants will receive handouts for each arrangement, plus a bonus few to try out back at school.
          We will also discuss how to set up a music lesson and acquire instruments, as well as, ideas on
          how to use easy access instrumentation such as chairs and rubbish bins. By the end of the session,
          applicants will have a greater understanding and confidence in teaching music to any age group.
        </p>

        <p>
          All instruments and resources for the session will be supplied, you only need to bring a voice to

          key skills students are required to learn in each KLA and develop a set of resources that can be

        <p>
          “I wanted to look into mindfulness as a way to develop resilience and social and emotional learning in
          young people because that helps to treat depression, but also to prevent depression,” Ms Zelvis said.
          “Mindfulness is about teaching young people how to be open and aware of the present moment as it unfolds,
          and be in tune with your thoughts and feelings and sit with them rather than fighting against them or
          trying to ignore them, because inevitably they always come back.”
